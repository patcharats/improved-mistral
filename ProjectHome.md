Improved-Mistral: A State-of-the-Art Speaker Verification System (Especially for NIST SRE)

This project is the collection of C/C++ programs for Speaker Verification/Recognition.

This project is developed based on the Mistral project, which is also an open source platform for biometrics authentication, developed by Laboratoire Informatique of Avignon.

Some new features are added by myself.
